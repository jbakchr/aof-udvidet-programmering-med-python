Exercise 7

Create a new Python in the same folder as your "main.py" file and save it as "calc.py".

In your "calc.py" file create the following simple mathematical functions:
- a "add" function that adds and returns two numbers
- a "subtract" function that subtracts and returns two numbers
- a "multiply" function that multiply and returns two numbers
- a "divide" function that divides and returns two numbers

Import your "calc" module into your "main.py" file and use each function from here
