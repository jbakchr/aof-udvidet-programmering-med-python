Exercise 3

Firstly, create these 2 classes:
- An "Employer" class
- An "Employee" class

The "Employer" class should:
- have a class attribute called "employees" set to an empty list
- have its "init" take a "name" argument
- have one method that adds an "employee" to its list of employees

The "Employee" class should:
- have an "init" method with a "name", "age" and "salary" argument
- have a method called "get_salary" that returns the employee salary
